# Fantom Testnet Squid

This squid monitors the chain, tokens, smart contracts and aggregates the results accordingly.

Dependencies: Node.js, Docker.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 0. Install @subsquid/cli a.k.a. the sqd command globally
npm i -g @subsquid/cli

# 1. Retrieve the template
sqd init my_squid_name -t evm
cd my_squid_name

# 2. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 3. Start a Postgres database container and detach
sqd up

# 4. Build and start the processor
sqd process

# 5. The command above will block the terminal
#    being busy with fetching the chain data, 
#    transforming and storing it in the target database.
#
#    To start the graphql server open the separate terminal
#    and run
sqd serve
```

A GraphiQL playground will be available at [localhost:4350/graphql](http://localhost:4350/graphql).

## Dev flow

### 1. Define database schema

Start development by defining the schema of the target database via `schema.graphql`.
Schema definition consists of regular graphql type declarations annotated with custom directives.
Full description of `schema.graphql` dialect is available [here](https://docs.subsquid.io/basics/schema-file).

### 2. Generate TypeORM classes

Mapping developers use TypeORM [EntityManager](https://typeorm.io/#/working-with-entity-manager)
to interact with target database during data processing. All necessary entity classes are
generated by the squid framework from `schema.graphql`. This is done by running `sqd codegen`
command.

### 3. Generate database migrations

All database changes are applied through migration files located at `db/migrations`.
`squid-typeorm-migration(1)` tool provides several commands to drive the process.

```bash
## drop create the database
sqd down
sqd up

## replace any old schemas with a new one made from the entities
sqd migration:generate
```

### 4. Import ABI contract and generate interfaces to decode events

It is necessary to import the respective ABI definition to decode EVM logs. One way to generate a type-safe facade class to decode EVM logs is by placing the relevant JSON ABIs to `./abi`, then using `squid-evm-typegen(1)` via an `sqd` script:

```bash
sqd typegen
```
